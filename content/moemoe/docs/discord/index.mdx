## key features

### core functionality

- **AI integration** - works with local LLM models ([koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)) or provider API
- **memory** - conversations are persistent with configurable retention (guild-wide or channel specific)
- **function calling** - let's the AI perform actions autonomously and even run its own slash commands

### discord features

- **economy** - guild-specific currency with customizable rewards
- **autoresponders** - create dynamic responses with placeholder support and arguments
- **gambling** - blackjack, coinflip, roulette, and ride the bus!
- **voice support** - join calls and converse with users

### customization

- **per-server settings** - each server can have its own configuration
- **greetings** - welcome new members with messages that support placeholders and embeds
- **boost messages** - thank your server boosters automatically upon boost

## who is moemoe for?

the moemoe-discord bot is perfect for:

1. **community servers** wanting wanting to bring their own mascot to life
2. **developers** interested in customizing and developing their own bot
3. **anyone** wanting their own bot to feel more responsive

## what moemoe isn't

moemoe is capable of doing lots of awesome things, but in order to set proper expectations:

- she is **not a moderation bot** - while she has some moderation capability, it is not the focus
- she is **not a music bot** - some cool voice features exist but not full on music streaming
- she is **not an art generator** - this will never, ever be added. matter of fact, if you ask moemoe to generate art, she'll likely yell at you
- she is also **not plug-and-play** - unless you invite my version of moemoe, this bot will require some technical setup, espcially for the AI backend and voice.

## for users

<Callout type='info'>
  production-ready moemoe is still in the works! she is still prone to many bugs
  and is awaiting some stress testing
</Callout>

## for developers

### getting started

ready to bring moemoe or your own character to your server? here's what you'll need:

- **node.js 18+** and npm installed
- **your discord bot token** from the [discord dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **AI backend of your choice** - either:
  - a local model with koboldcpp or ooba (recommended)
  - API access to any cloud provider (coming soon)

the setup process is relatively straightfoward if you have your AI backend already in place, but it does require some technical knowledge. fear not! i've got a [quick start guide]() that will walk you through everything.

## community & support

while moemoe is still in active development, i'd love for you to join our community:

- **moemoe's server** - https://discord.gg/rn9j69ApJQ
- **github** - to [contribute](https://github.com/conjureme/moemoe-discord) or report issues
