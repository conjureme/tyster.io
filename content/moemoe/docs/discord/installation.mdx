<Callout type='warn'>
  this page is for those interested in running their own installation of moemoe.
</Callout>

## prerequisites

before diving in, ensure you have the following:

- **node.js 18+** and npm installed
- **git** for cloning the repository
- **Discord bot token** from the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- **AI backend** with an API

## AI backend

moemoe requires some sort of AI backend to function and you've plenty of options available:

### for local models (recommended)

running a local LLM gives you full control and no API costs, but does require a somewhat beefy PC depending on the model's size. i would recommend [koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp) for how awesome it is.

<Callout type='info'>
  a mid-tier gaming PC may be able to run 7-13B quantizized models. larger models will require more resources.

as of writing, moemoe is running on [Mistral-Small-24b-Instruct-2501](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501). bear in mind, smaller models will struggle with remembering rules and function syntax.

</Callout>

quick KoboldCPP setup:

1. download [KoboldCPP](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp)
2. grab a model that will fit on your PC
3. run KoboldCPP and take note of the URL
   - by default this will be localhost:5001

### cloud providers

openai and other provider support is coming soon. for now, local models are the way to go.

## bot installation

<Steps>
<Step>

### clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conjureme/moemoe-discord.git
cd moemoe-discord
```

</Step>
<Step>

### install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

this will install all required packages including discord.js

</Step>
<Step>

### configure environment

copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

open `.env` and add your variables:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=client_id_here
API_PROVIDER=koboldcpp
```

</Step>
<Step>

### configure AI settings

edit `config/ai.json` and adjust sampler settings to your liking:

```json
{
  "maxTokens": 500,
  "temperature": 1.0
}
```

<Callout>
  currently a very unpleasant method of adjusting settingsâ€”a UI is in the works.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### customize moemoe's personality

edit `config/bot.json` to define moemoe's personality or make your own persona:

```json
{
  "name": "moemoe",
  "description": "a friendly and helpful discord bot",
  "data": {
    "system_prompt": "you are moemoe, a helpful discord bot...",
    "first_mes": "hiya! i'm moemoe!",
    "mes_example": "example dialogue here"
  }
}
```

this entire file is structured as a v2 Tavern Character Card. you can copy and paste characters if you prefer.

</Step>
<Step>

### deploy commands

before first run, deploy the slash commands:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

</Step>
<Step>

### start the bot

```bash
npm run dev
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## inviting moemoe

once running, you'll need to invite moemoe to your server:

1. go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. select your application
3. navigate to OAuth2 > URL Generator
4. select these scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
5. select perms you want or ensure bot has proper roles
6. copy the generated URL and open it to invite moemoe

## bot in your server, try these:

- [ ] try `/ping` to verify bot and commands are working
- [ ] test AI interaction with `@moemoe hello!`
- [ ] test AI responses to ensure it's acting correctly

## troubleshooting

### moemoe won't respond

- check that your AI backend is running and accessible
- verify the APIs in `.env` are correct
- ensure moemoe has permission to read and send messages
- enable debug mode and check terminal output for errors

### commands aren't showing

- run `npm run deploy` or `npm run deploy:global` again
- refresh discord with CTRL + R and retry
- try deploying to your specific guild instead of globally

### AI responses are weird

- ensure `config/ai.json` is using the right instruction format and sampler settings
- try lowering your temperature

### voice support

<Callout type='info'>
  this is another WIP. voice functionality is currently hardcoded, but you can
  implement it by setting up and following the following steps.
</Callout>

for voice features, you'll also need:

- @discordjs/voice
- sodium-native
- [rvc-python](https://github.com/daswer123/rvc-python)
- [KokoroTTS API](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI)

### whisper transcription

koboldcpp supports running a whisper model in tandem, you can get one from here:

- https://huggingface.co/koboldcpp/whisper/tree/main

## next steps

now that moemoe is running:

- configure her personality to match your server or desired character
- explore [available commands](/moemoe/docs/discord/commands)
- set up your [economy system](/moemoe/docs/discord/economy)
- create [autoresponders](/moemoe/docs/discord/autoresponders)

<Callout type='warning'>
  always remember to keep your bot token and API keys secret! never commit them
  to version control or hand them out.
